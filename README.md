# HYF Workshop - Introduction to working with Contentful as a CMS

The goal of this workshop is to take a simple blog post make it into a template that can render blog posts with content managed in Contentful.
First step is to register with Contentful and setup a new space.
Secondly, you'll want to create a content model for your blog post with the relevant fields.
Once that is complete you can create the HTML/CSS to show your blog post (we included a sample you can use if you want to).
Lastly - you'll need to connect the HTML template with Contentful to fetch the content and render it. An easy way to achieve this is using javascript.
